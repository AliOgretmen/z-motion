                <p> OK, so here we go. I need some money.. ha ha, no (and yes at the same time), but I want to start to have a little side income from my art stuff if at the very least to pay for the tools I use or new hardware to purchase in the down times when I'm in-between jobs, which I am at the moment. But because I'm a versatile guy, I'm not gonna limit this to drawings/paintings only. As you may have realized, depending on the time I spend on my drawings/paintings they can get relatively good, and I'd like to start to gain experience in drawing/painting for other people. But because I'm a realist and my drawing/painting skills ain't up to par yet, I'll adjust the prices for those types of work accordingly and offer other things as well. </p>
                <p>So for your convenience I'll list first some things about me so you get a better picture about my skills:
                    <br> - I'm a computer sciences student in my last semester, but I've worked for about three to four years in the field, sometimes as freelancer and sometimes as an intern. I also currently teach a class on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I think I'm not exaggerating (even though it might seem so when reading through this sentence xD) when I'm saying I'm a relatively experienced software engineer; I've been in this field for about 6-7 years if you include my years at the university. And I hear you saying "well, if you're that good, why don't you get a job in that field", but again, this is supposed to be some side income with the purpose to learn to work for other people. I obviously am intending to work in my appropriate field for the next two to three years at the very least.</p>
                Languages, Frameworks etc. I know well: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, AngularJS, Angular 2, C#, WPF, WCF, ASP .Net, C/C++, Qt, wxWidgets, Cocos2d, Android, Java, GWT, Spring Framework, Thymeleaf, Razor, MySQL, MSSQL, Postgres, PHP, Python etc. As you might imagine, a bachelor program in computer sciences pretty much teaches you to deal with any language on any platform. (I obviously now also things like setting up a website per WordPress, Joomla, hosting websites etc. etc.) <br>

<p>If you think I might do something for you in this regard, contact me and we'll see. I won't offer comissions on those things. My github: github.com/Zmote <br>

- I've been working as a freelancer graphic designer for about 4-5 years. I'm self-taught in this regard, but got to work with a lot of clients over the past years, designing logo's, fyler's, brochures, web elements etc. Also, in that time frame, I got to develop some 2D and 3D Animations for some clients (like short clips conveying what the corporation is doing). A showreel (a little outdated, 2010) of some projects I did back then: <br>
If you're interested in some of my design works, check out my design vector gallery: zmote.deviantart.com/gallery/3… <br>
And if you wonder why some vary in quality, it's because of time, for some I had time, some were just experiments and back in the day I uploaded anything here. Why am I not cleaning it up? Because it's my history. Might it be counter-productive, yes. ?( ´  ? ` )? <br>

- I also do musical compositions with FL Studio. I'm nowhere good, but if you need some intro music, some background music etc. I might provide some for you that might satisfy your needs. Check out my soundcloud for some samples: soundcloud.com/zmote <br>

- I speak four languages, German, Turkish, English, French. I also took two semester in Japanese, but can't do much with it at the moment. So, need something translated? I might provide some translation work, basic stuff at the very least. Don't know what, I'm just sayin'. <br>

- I also do write a lot and I've managed to get two articles published in two different magazines. I'm working on my own novels on the side when I have time, but yeah. If you figure I could do something for you with that, hit me up and we'll see what we can organize. <br>

ALRIGHT, that was a little longer than I wished, but at least now you have some grasp of what I can do and what I can't. And now, for comissions I'll offer: <br>

    Availability: Yes, I'm available right now.</p>

<p>Let's make this simple, I'll offer two types, simple (S) and complex (C), we can discuss the price, but those are the ranges. I'll adjust them over time, but this is something to start with: <br>
 
Graphic Design Work: <br>
1. Logo Design: (S) 20$, (C) 50$ - 80$
2. Flyer Design: (S) 20$, (C) 40 - 80$
3. Brochure Design: (S) 40$, (C)
4. Business Card: (S) 20$, (C) 50$
5. Other (Magazine Design for example): (S) 80$, (C) 120$ - 200$ <br>

3D Work: <br>
1. Set Designs: (S) 40$, (C) 80$ - 120$
2: Props: (S) 20$, (C) 40$ - 80$
3: Simple Character: 120$ <br>

2. Intro Music: (S) 40$, (C) 60$
3. Background Music: (S) 40$, (C) 80$
4. Other?: 40$ - 120$ <br>

6. 3 Panel Comic: (S) 10$, (C) 20$ - 40$
                </p> <br>

<p>Alright, if you want me to design a website for you, the price ranges would be along: 200 - 400$ for WordPress Websites, around 600$ to 1500$ for more complex websites. <br><br>
And if you wonder what I mean by simple and complex, it's more about time investment, ie. if I say simple, I mean a work of art worth of 30-60 min time, if I mean complex, something around 2h - 8h, maybe more. The prices will vary accordingly. <br><br>

I hope some of you might choose to give me some work. As payment I've a paypal account setup, so I'll link you the payment page once we come to an agreement over the work. <br><br>
